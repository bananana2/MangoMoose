Instructions
It all starts with whipping the heavy cream. I like to whip it over ice filled bowl to keep it chilled all times until whipped.
Whip the cream until soft peaks. It will take around 5-8 minutes to achieve that consistency.
Once the cream is whipped to soft peaks as shown in the photo keep it in the refrigerator to chill while you work with mango puree.
In a bowl dilute agar agar powder with water, mix it with a spoon and let it sit for a minute. This helps agar agar to dissolve well.
Now whisk the agar mixture with mango puree in a sauce pan. Heat up the mango agar agar mixture on medium heat stirring occasionally.
Add in any flavoring at this point. I have added cardamom and saffron.
Let the mixture come to a simmer. This will make sure that agar has dissolved completely. Now take the mixture off the stove top at let it cool to room temperature.
While the mixture is cooling down it will start to set up because of agar-agar. Keep a close watch while it cools down as we don't want it to set but we are looking for a pourable consistency. Lukewarm is acceptable. It will take around 10-12 minutes to cool down after the simmer.
For some reason, if the mango puree sets up before mixing it with the whipped cream then reheat it to get a flowy consistency.
For next step take out the whipped cream from the fridge. With the electric whip switched on add mango agar agar mixture to the whipped cream. Beat it immediately and continuously on high speed for 30 seconds until mixed well. ( It will further set in the fridge later)
Now scoop the mixture in desired serving bowls or glasses.
Top it with cling wrap and let it set in the fridge for 4-6 hours to chill before serving.
I like to make this dessert a day before I intend serve it.
